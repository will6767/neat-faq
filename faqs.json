      "question": "Can Neat Frame work on a Wi-Fi network that uses a captive portal?",
      "answer": "Neat Frame does not officially support captive portal Wi-Fi networks. However, it may still work in some cases. To test this, connect Neat Frame to the network and click the small pop-up notification that appears after connection. This may open the captive portal webpage, allowing you to approve access.\n\nBecause results can be inconsistent, captive portal networks are not officially supported, even though this approach has worked in most cases.",
